# PotHeads for Goa Hacks 1.0

## The whole site of PotHeads. 

The FrontEnd was build mainly using the materialize.css framework and some jquery.
It was mostly handled by Suniti Gaonkar

Rudraksh handled the collection of data from the front end using flask a python library for backend. 

I wrote the code for the display of map from the given data using the folium library in python and managed the input and output of data to a csv file using pandas.

All 3 of us learnt most of the things in first 8 hours of  the hackathon and then started worthing.

### We won the first prize for the overall project.
